    <div class="box backstory">
      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>Parfaits originated in France in the late 19th century, <br> with the name parfait meaning “perfect” in French. <br> The original French parfait was a frozen dessert made with sugar syrup, egg yolks, and cream, similar to a custard or mousse, and was traditionally served in a tall glass.</p>
      <p>While no single person is credited with its invention, <br> it was developed by French chefs and later adapted in different countries with their own variations.</p>
